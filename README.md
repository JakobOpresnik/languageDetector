# LANGUAGE IDENTIFIER

#### Language model developed for detecting/identifying language based on building language profiles from character ***N***-grams.

The model was trained on large corpora of documents (30k lines of text for each of the 5 supported languages).
It supports the following languages:
- English
- German
- Slovene
- Spanish
- Croatian

Initial model testing on 25 different text documents (400 lines each) for each of the 5 languages showed a 100% accuracy of the model for all supported languages.
